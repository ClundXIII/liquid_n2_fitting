# What is this?

Put liquid nitrogen in a vacuum chamber. Turn on the pump. Enjoy.
I wrote about 5 pages of theory, I might put them up later for reference :)

# Compile

make

# Clean

make clean

# Run

## Run Simulation

./liquid_n2_fitting

## Run fit (interactive)

./liquid_n2_fitting fit

# Alternative:

Use Codeblocks and open Project File

## plot data with gnuplot

gnuplot gp_script.plt

The resulting filename will be "fit_plot.eps". Feel free to change the script to suit your needs ;-)
